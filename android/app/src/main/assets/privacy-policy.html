      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        MyActivityMonitor is a simple application that shows your daily activity using
        data available on your device. We designed the app to read the minimum
        necessary information and to process it on the device.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Health Connect data we access (Android)</h2>
      <p>
        On Android devices that support <strong>Health Connect</strong>, the app requests
        <em>read-only</em> access to the following record types, solely to display your
        daily progress inside the app:
      </p>
      <table aria-label="Health Connect data types">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Data type</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Scope</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="mono">StepsRecord</span> (Steps)</td>
            <td>Calculate and display the total number of steps for the current day.</td>
            <td>Read-only; aggregated on-device for “today”.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><span class="mono">ExerciseSessionRecord</span> (Exercise sessions)</td>
            <td>Calculate and display total active minutes for the current day.</td>
            <td>Read-only; aggregated on-device for “today”.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p class="note">
        The app does <strong>not</strong> request write access and does <strong>not</strong>
        access any other Health Connect data types.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we use your information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To compute and display your <strong>steps</strong> and <strong>active minutes</strong> for the day.</li>
        <li>To compare those values against goals that you set in the app.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">We do not use your health data for advertising, profiling, or analytics.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>On‑device processing &amp; data sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Health data read through Health Connect is processed <strong>on your device</strong> only.
        We do not transfer, sell, or share your health data with third parties. The app
        does not maintain remote servers for health data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Permissions &amp; control</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can <strong>grant or revoke</strong> Health Connect permissions at any time in the system settings.</li>
        <li>If permissions are revoked, the app will stop reading those data types and will display zeros or placeholders.</li>
        <li>You can uninstall the app at any time; the app does not export your health data off-device.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Other data</h2>
      <p>
        The app may store your <strong>goal settings</strong> (e.g., steps and minutes targets) locally on the device
        so they persist across app launches. These settings do not contain health data and are not shared.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        MyActivityMonitor does not retain Health Connect records. Health data is queried from Health Connect when you open
        or refresh the app and is not stored by the app. Locally stored goal settings remain until you change them or uninstall the app.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data deletion</h2>
      <p>
        MyActivityMonitor does not collect or store any personal or health data
        outside your device. All data used by the app — such as your daily steps
        and activity sessions — are read directly from Health Connect and remain
        under your control within that system.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can delete your data at any time in one of the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By uninstalling the app, which removes all locally stored goal settings
          and preferences from your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using the <strong>Health Connect</strong> system app to delete the
          underlying health records (e.g., steps or exercise sessions).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because the app does not store data on external servers, no additional
        deletion request is required.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We rely on the platform security of Android and Health Connect to control access to health data.
        The app requests the minimum permissions required and uses read-only access.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        MyActivityMonitor is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child has provided health data
        through the app, please revoke Health Connect permissions and uninstall the app.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the
        “Last updated” date above.
      </p>
